# NonceArt Documentation

Permanent on-chain canvas. Own pixels, create art, trade on the marketplace.
## What is NonceArt?

[NonceArt](https://nonce.art) is a collaborative pixel art canvas where ownership lives permanently on the blockchain. Think Million Dollar Homepage meets NFTs, but fully decentralized with no custom smart contract. Gasless thanks to [x402 protocol](https://x402.org).

**Canvas**: 2,400 × 1,675 pixels (4,020,000 total pixels)

**Key Features**:
- **Own pixels permanently**: 0.99 USDC per pixel (1 USDC total with painting)
- **No gas fees**: Gasless transactions via x402 protocol
- **Set URLs and descriptions**: Turn your tiles into clickable links
- **Peer-to-peer marketplace**: Buy and sell tiles directly
- **On-chain forever**: Data stored in USDC contract nonces

**How It Works**:
1. Reserve canvas area (1% upfront)
2. Complete payment (98% remaining)
3. Paint and customize your tile
4. List for sale or keep forever
